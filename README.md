# Penguins
Game made as an university project  
Rules:  
--------------  
| INTRODUCTION |  
 --------------  
Hungry penguins at the pole hop from ice floe to ice floe in search of fish. They try to block their rivals   
and secure the highest yielding fishing grounds for themselves. At the end, whoever has captured the most fish  
is the winner of this game to and fro across the floes.  
 ------------  
| GAME SETUP |  
 ------------  
Each player gets some penguins (depending on the number of players):  
  
With 2 players, 4 penguins each  
With 3 players, 3 penguins each  
With 4 players or more (up to 9), 2 penguins each  
  
In turn, each player places one of his/her penguins on an ice floe containing precisely one fish (This is the placement  
stage). This stage ends when all the penguins have been placed on the board.  
 ------------------  
| PLAYING THE GAME |  
 ------------------  
Once all penguins are on ice floes, the fishing begins!  
  
A game turn consists of moving one of the player's penguins and afterwards removing the ice floe on   
which the penguin was standing at the beginning of the turn.   
  
A penguin can move as far as he likes over ice floes but there are some restrictions...  
  
- The penguin's path needs to be a straight line (the penguin cannot change its direction during its motion).  
  
- The moving penguin cannot jump over an other penguin or a water square.  
 -----------------  
| END OF THE GAME |  
 -----------------  
If a player cannot move any of his penguins, he picks up all of his penguins and the ice floes where they stand.  
The other players continue playing until they too can no longer move their penguins. If only one player can move,   
he carries on by himself as long as possible. Finally the players count their collected fish.   
  
The player with the most fish is the winner. If 2 or more players have accumulated the same number of fish, victory   
goes to the one with the most ice floes.   
  
If this is also tied, the game ends inconclusively...
